# streamer.bot-things
This is my repo for my streamer.bot setup for different game intergrations that I have done. 

Currently there are 3 intergrations. 

Links to any other game mode, or 3rd party software I need will be linked in the respective folder. 

1) 7 Days to Die - A20 *I have not tested with A21 yet*. 

2) Minecraft using RCON with 3rd party WebRCON setup that allows you to send RCON commands with HTTP Interface. 

3) Minecraft using KK64 Mod that will create a Websocket server for Minecraft and allow you to run console comands via that interface. 

If you are you looking for a specific game you can hit me up via Discord link @ https://socials.bofh.me

I also stream on twitch when time allows so you can drop by there also http://twitch.tv/itsthebofh
